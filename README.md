# Store Simulation

Android project for Mobile App Development course at Faculty of Computing.

The goal of the project was to utilise everything that we have learned during the semester, including MVVM architecture, data fetching from server using Retrofit and JSON conversion using Moshi, data persistence using Room and SharedPreferences...

The idea of the application is to be a store simulation, with functionalities such as listing, searching and filterting products, adding products to cart and paying.
